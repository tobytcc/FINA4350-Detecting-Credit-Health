0,0,Moody,Evergrande,B2,https://www.moodys.com/research/Moodys-downgrades-Evergrandes-bond-rating-to-B2-outlook-negative--PR_212356,"


Hong Kong, January 10, 2011 -- Moody's Investors Service has today revised the outlook of Evergrande 
Real Estate Group Limited's (""Evergrande"") B1 corporate family 
rating to negative from stable. 


At the same time, Moody's has downgraded Evergrande's senior 
unsecured bond rating to B2 from B1 and has assigned a B2 senior unsecured 
rating to its proposed senior unsecured bonds.


The outlook of the senior unsecured debt rating is negative.


RATINGS RATIONALE


The rating actions follow the company's announcement that it will issue 
senior unsecured bonds to fund existing and new projects, as well 
as repayment of a portion of its onshore bank loans. The proposed 
bond wills have the same terms and covenants as and rank pari passu with 
the company's existing US$ bonds due 2015. 


""The negative outlook reflects Evergrande's increased levels 
of business and financial risks over the next 12-18 months as it 
pursues a fast expansion -- targeting sales growth of about 40% 
to RMB 70 billion -- and when Moody's expects the property 
market and bank credit environment in China to be more challenging,"" 
says Kaven Tsang, a Moody's AVP/Analyst.


""While the new bond proceeds will provide the company with funding for 
its fast growth plan and will lengthen its debt maturity profile, 
the increased debt (net of refinancing) will keep Evergrande's adjusted 
debt/capitalization at a high level of more than 60-65%, 
therefore raising its financial risk,"" says Tsang, also Moody's 
lead analyst for Evergrande. ""This ratio will weakly position 
the company at the B1 rating level"".


""The downgrade of the bond rating to B2 reflects Evergrande's 
increased legal and structural subordination risks. Its fast growth 
has resulted in a higher level of onshore debt, which has in turn 
raised its secured and subsidiary debt-to-total assets ratio 
to above 20%. Moody's does not expect such a level 
to fall, given Evergrande's ambitious business plan,"" 
says Tsang.


Furthermore, Evergrande's B1 corporate family rating continues 
to reflect its appetite for fast growth which -- as indicated -- 
attracts high development and execution risks. It also considers 
Evergrande's strengths as one of the largest developers in China, 
as measured by contracted sales, the size of its land bank, 
and its portfolio's good geographical diversification. Projected 
EBITDA interest coverage of 3-4x is also in line with its B1 peers.


Evergrande's ratings could be under pressure for downgrade if (1) 
its sales or profit margins decline because of a significant downturn 
in China's property market or an aggressive pricing strategy to pursue 
ambitious sales target; (2) liquidity declines due to continue aggressive 
land acquisitions, and/or a slowdown in sales; or (3) further 
debt is raised, resulting in adjusted debt/capitalization consistently 
above 60-65% , or EBITDA/interest under 2.5x-3x.


On the other hand, Evergrande's ratings could return to stable 
if Evergrande (1) refines its business plan to reduce its financial risk, 
such that debt leverage, measured by Debt/Total Capitalization, 
is reduced to below 60% - 65% and EBITDA/interest 
rises above 4x; and (2) maintains an adequate level of liquidity 
in support of its large scale development.


Moody's last rating action with regard to Evergrande took place on April 
14, 2010, when Moody's affirmed the B1 corporate family rating 
and senior unsecured rating following its additional US$600 million 
bond issuance.


The principal methodology used in this rating was Global Homebuilding 
Industry published in March 2009.


Evergrande Real Estate Group Limited is one of the major residential housing 
developers in China, with a standardized operating model. 
Founded in 1996 in Guangzhou, Guangdong Province, the company 
has rapidly expanded its geographic coverage to 62 cities in China in 
the past few years, and maintains a land bank of around 95.8 
million sqm in gross floor area.

Moody's downgrades Evergrande's bond rating to B2; outlook negative"
1,1,Fitch,Evergrande,D,https://www.fitchratings.com/research/corporate-finance/fitch-downgrades-evergrande-subsidiaries-hengda-tianji-to-restricted-default-09-12-2021,"Fitch Ratings - Hong Kong - 09 Dec 2021: Fitch Ratings has downgraded to 'RD' (Restricted Default), from 'C', the Long-Term Foreign-Currency Issuer Default Ratings (IDR) of Chinese homebuilder China Evergrande Group and its subsidiaries, Hengda Real Estate Group Co., Ltd and Tianji Holding Limited. Fitch has affirmed the senior unsecured ratings of Evergrande and Tianji at 'C', with a Recovery Rating of 'RR6', as well as the Tianji-guaranteed senior unsecured notes issued by Scenery Journey Limited at 'C', with a Recovery Rating of 'RR6'.The downgrades reflect the non-payment of coupons due 6 November 2021 for Tianji's USD645 million 13% bonds and USD590 million 13.75% bonds after the grace period lapsed on 6 December. The non-payment is consistent with an 'RD' rating, signifying the uncured expiry of any applicable grace period, cure period or default forbearance period following a payment default on a material financial obligation.Key Rating DriversNon-Payment of Coupons: There has been no announcement from the company or the trustee regarding the coupon payments due 6 November for the two Tianji bonds after the grace periods lapsed. In addition, the company did not respond to our request for confirmation on the coupon payments. We are therefore assuming they were not paid.Failure to make coupon payments within the grace period is consistent with Fitch's definition of an 'RD' rating, as the company has experienced an uncured payment default on a material financial obligation but has not yet entered into bankruptcy filings, administration, receivership, liquidation, or other formal winding-up procedures, and has not otherwise ceased operating.Cross Default with Notes: Tianji is a restricted subsidiary of Evergrande, and the non-payment has triggered an event of default on Evergrande's bonds. As a result, Tianji and Evergrande's other US dollar notes will become due immediately and payable if the bond trustee or holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the offshore notes declare so.Uncertainty over Restructuring Plan: Evergrande announced on 6 December the formation of a Risk Management Committee that comprises the company's senior management, representatives from Guangzhou state-owned enterprises, such as Guangdong Holdings Limited and Guangzhou Yuexiu Holdings Limited, as well as representatives from financial institutions such as China Cinda Asset Management Co., Ltd. (A/Stable), to mitigate and eliminate the group's future risks. There is limited information available on the company's restructuring plan at this stage.Derivation SummaryEvergrande, Hengda and Tianji's IDRs have been downgraded to 'RD' in line with our definition of an uncured payment default but there has been no initiation of bankruptcy filings, administration, receivership, liquidation, or other formal winding-up procedures as yet with business operations continuing.Key AssumptionsKEY RECOVERY RATING ASSUMPTIONSEvergrandeThe recovery analysis assumes that Evergrande would be liquidated in a bankruptcy because it is an asset-trading company. We assume both Hengda and Evergrande would go into bankruptcy if Evergrande defaults.We have assumed a 10% administrative claim.Liquidation ApproachThe liquidation estimate reflects Fitch's view of the value of balance-sheet assets that can be realised in sale or liquidation processes conducted during a bankruptcy or insolvency proceeding and distributed to creditors. - 60% advance rate applied to net inventory given EBITDA margin of below 20%- 70% advance rate applied to trade receivables, which mainly arose from sales of properties; 87% of trade receivables are within 90 days- 60% advance rate applied to property, plant and equipment (PPE), which mainly comprise buildings and construction in progress- 10% advance rate applied to investment properties based on a conservative 6.5% cap on annualised rental income.- 100% advance rate applied to available cash, but we have also added trade payables to the liability waterfallWe excluded restricted cash as there is no breakdown on how much can be used for debt repayment. The amount is immaterial.We excluded investments in joint ventures of CNY88 billion, which mainly include stakes in non-property businesses that could be illiquid, such as CNY30 billion for its 36% stake in Shengjing Bank and CNY18 billion for its 50% stake in Evergrande Life Insurance based on end-2020 breakdown. We note that the company sold a 19.9% stake in Shengjing Bank for around CNY10 billion in September 2021, but the proceeds were used to settle onshore loans from the bank.We estimate Evergrande's liquidation value by deconsolidating Hengda, Evergrande Auto and Evergrande Property Services. We estimate the residual value of Hengda and Evergrande Auto by assuming they will be liquidated as they are asset trading businesses (Evergrande Auto's electric-vehicle business remains loss-making). We expect the residual values of Hengda and Evergrande Auto to both be zero after paying off their own debt.We estimate the residual value of Evergrande's stake in Evergrande Property Services based on the going-concern approach. We applied a 4x enterprise value/EBITDA multiple and our estimated recovery value is at a 14% discount to the market value on 8 December, or 20% discount to the price that was agreed on for the disposal of the stake to Hopson Development Holdings Limited (B+/Stable) in October that was subsequently cancelled.The allocation of value in the liability waterfall results in recovery corresponding to 'RR6' for the senior unsecured notes.TianjiThe recovery analysis assumes that Tianji would be liquidated in a bankruptcy because it is an asset-trading company. We have assumed a 10% administrative claim.Liquidation ApproachThe liquidation estimate reflects Fitch's view of the value of balance-sheet assets that can be realised in sale or liquidation processes conducted during a bankruptcy or insolvency proceeding and distributed to creditors. - 60% advance rate applied to net inventory given EBITDA margin of below 20%- 70% advance rate applied to trade receivables, which mainly arose from sales of properties. - 60% advance rate applied to PPE- 10% advance rate applied to investment properties based on a conservative 6.5% cap on annualised rental income.- 100% advance rate applied to available cash, which is less than trade payablesThe allocation of value in the liability waterfall results in recovery corresponding to 'RR6' for the senior unsecured notes.RATING SENSITIVITIESFactors that could, individually or collectively, lead to positive rating action/upgrade: Factors that could, individually or collectively, lead to negative rating action/downgrade:Best/Worst Case Rating ScenarioInternational scale credit ratings of Non-Financial Corporate issuers have a best-case rating upgrade scenario (defined as the 99th percentile of rating transitions, measured in a positive direction) of three notches over a three-year rating horizon; and a worst-case rating downgrade scenario (defined as the 99th percentile of rating transitions, measured in a negative direction) of four notches over three years.

2,2,Moody,Evergrande,B2,https://www.moodys.com/research/Moodys-downgrades-Evergrandes-rating-to-B2-outlook-negative--PR_342117,"


Hong Kong, January 11, 2016 -- Moody's Investors Service has downgraded Evergrande Real Estate 
Group Limited's corporate family rating to B2 from B1 and its senior 
unsecured debt rating to B3 from B2.


The outlook for the ratings is negative.


RATINGS RATIONALE 


""The downgrade reflects Evergrande's increased level of financial 
risk, which is in turn because of its highly acquisitive appetite 
and debt-funded strategy for acquisitions,"" says Franco Leung, 
a Moody's Vice President and Senior Analyst.


In 2H 2015, Evergrande announced acquisitions including but not 
limited to (1) various Chinese property-development project companies 
from New World Development (China) Limited (unrated) and Chow Tai Fook 
Enterprises Ltd (unrated); (2) an investment property in Hong Kong; 
and (3) a 50% equity stake in a life insurance company. 



These acquisitions -- which totaled around RMB59.5 
billion in cost -- will be paid for by instalments over 
the next 2-6 years, starting from the dates of each transaction's 
announcement.


In 2016, Evergrande will be required to pay around RMB30 billion.


Moody's considers such acquisitions as highly aggressive, 
and they also raise business risk because the company is expanding when 
China's property market remains challenging due to the oversupply 
of inventory in the lower tier cities. 


Evergrande also still has land banks in these lower tier cities.


Moody's expects Evergrande's debt leverage -- measured 
by revenue/adjusted debt -- to remain weak in the 47%-53% 
range over the next 12-18 months, versus around 53% 
at end-June 2015. 


Such a level is weak for its B2 corporate family rating.


The company's high level of debt -- with the resultant heavy 
annual repayments -- will also strain cash flow over the 
next 2 years, in turn weakening its liquidity position. 


""The downgrade also reflects the aggressive buy-back options 
offered in its presales contracts, a situation which adds uncertainty 
to its cash flow,"" says Leung, who is also the Lead 
Analyst for Evergrande.


Evergrande has offered buyers an option to sell back their purchased properties, 
and Moody's expects cash outflows will consequently increase when 
the property market weakens.


The B2 corporate family rating reflects Evergrande's strong market position 
as one of the top five property developers in China in terms of contracted 
sales and the size of its land bank.


In addition, the rating reflects its national coverage in China, 
as well as its broad geographic coverage, strong sales execution, 
low-cost land bank and focus on mass-market residential 
properties.


On the other hand, the rating is constrained by the high business 
and financial risks associated with Evergrande's strategy to pursue rapid 
debt-funded growth. Its debt leverage and financial metrics 
are weak for its B2 corporate family rating.


Evergrande's liquidity position is also weak because it has to fund 
high levels of construction costs and deferred acquisition payments -- 
in addition to its debt repayments -- to support its large 
scale of development. 


Such cash outflows will consume its cash-on-hand and presales 
proceeds. 


Moody's notes that the company raised contracted sales and borrowings 
in 2015, resulting in a high level of cash at end-December 
2015, and which totaled RMB158 billion on an unaudited basis.


The negative outlook reflects Evergrande's high levels of business, 
financial and liquidity risks, given its aggressive debt-funded 
acquisitions.


Downward rating pressure could emerge if: (1) Moody's expects 
the company's liquidity position to weaken further due to a deterioration 
in contracted sales, and/or high levels of payments on debt and 
land, or high levels of deferred acquisition payables; (2) 
the company raises more debt, and which results in revenue/adjusted 
debt (including perpetual securities) falling below 40%, 
or (3) the company takes on more debt-funded acquisitions.


Upward rating pressure is unlikely, given the negative outlook.


However, the rating could return to stable if the company (1) reduces 
its debt leverage, such that revenue/adjusted debt rises above 60% 
and EBIT/interest rises to 2x or higher; and (2) improves its liquidity 
position.


The principal methodology used in these ratings was Homebuilding And Property 
Development Industry published in April 2015. Please see the Credit 
Policy page on www.moodys.com for a copy of this methodology.


Evergrande Real Estate Group Limited is one of the major residential developers 
in China. It has a standardized operating model.


Founded in 1996 in Guangzhou, the company has rapidly expanded its 
business across the country over the past few years. At 30 June 
2015, its land bank totaled 144 million square meters in gross floor 
area across 154 Chinese cities.

Moody's downgrades Evergrande's rating to B2; outlook negative"
3,3,Moody,Evergrande,,https://www.moodys.com/research/Moodys-downgrades-Evergrandes-and-its-subsidiaries-ratings-reviews-ratings-for--PR_449727,"


Hong Kong, June 30, 2021 -- Moody's Investors Service has downgraded the corporate family ratings 
(CFR) of China Evergrande Group (Evergrande), Hengda Real Estate 
Group Company Limited (Hengda), Tianji Holding Limited (Tianji) 
and the backed senior unsecured ratings of Scenery Journey Limited.


The affected ratings are as follows:


• Evergrande's CFR has been downgraded to B2 from B1, 
and its senior unsecured ratings have been downgraded to B3 from B2;


• Hengda's CFR has been downgraded to B2 from B1;


• Tianji's CFR has been downgraded to B3 from B2;


• Scenery Journey's backed senior unsecured ratings have been 
downgraded to B3 from B2;


The backed senior unsecured rating on the notes issued by Scenery Journey 
are guaranteed by Tianji. The notes are also supported by a keepwell 
deed and a deed of equity interest purchase undertaking between Hengda, 
Tianji, Scenery Journey and the bond trustee.


At the same time, Moody's has placed the ratings under review for 
further downgrade. The previous ratings outlook was negative.


Hengda is a 60%-owned onshore subsidiary of Evergrande. 
It also owns 100% of Tianji, which in turn owns 100% 
of Scenery Journey.


""The downgrade reflects Evergrande's weakened funding access and reduced 
liquidity buffer given its large debt maturities in the coming 12-18 
months amid the tight credit environment in China and volatility in the 
capital markets,"" says Cedric Lai, a Moody's Vice President 
and Senior Analyst.


Although Evergrande has been reducing its debt to improve its financial 
stability, the company still faces sizeable maturing debt and puttable 
bonds over the next 12-18 months. In addition, its 
trade payables increased to RMB622 billion at the end of 2020 from RMB545 
billion at the end of 2019, which funded part of the debt reduction.


Moody's expects the company will continue to focus on generating internal 
cash to pay its maturing debts and fund its operations over the next 12-18 
months. However, the review for downgrade reflects the uncertainty 
over the company's ability to materially reduce its debt and payables 
to more sustainable levels, given its heightened financial risk.


RATINGS RATIONALE


Evergrande's B2 CFR reflects the company's strong market position 
as one of the top three property developers in China (A1 stable) in terms 
of contracted sales and land bank size. The CFR also reflects the 
company's nationwide geographic coverage, strong sales execution 
and low-cost land bank.


Nevertheless, the rating is constrained by Evergrande's sizable 
maturing debt over the next 12-18 months, high proportion 
of trust loans and moderate credit metrics. The company's significant 
investments in its non-property businesses also constrain its credit 
profile. 


Evergrande's cash on hand of RMB181 billion as of the end of 2020 
was not sufficient to cover its short term debt of RMB335 billion as of 
the same date. However, Moody's expects the company 
to continue to generate operating cash flow in the next 12 months, 
backed by contracted sales growth and high cash collection rate, 
which will cover the shortfall, the company's dividends and 
committed land payments over the same period. 


Moody's expects the company's contracted sales will grow modestly to around 
RMB750 billion in 2021 and RMB760 billion in 2022, supported by 
its strong sales execution. The company's contracted sales 
grew 5% to RMB285.2 billion in the first five months of 
2021 compared with a year ago, with company's estimated cash 
collection ratio of 88%.


Moody's expects that Evergrande will reduce spending on land and control 
debt growth over the next 12-18 months, given its high debt 
leverage. Accordingly, Moody's expects that Evergrande's 
debt leverage — as measured by revenue/adjusted debt (excluding 
payables) — will improve to 75%-80% over the 
next 12-18 months from 68% in 2020. Similarly, 
Moody's expects Hengda's revenue/adjusted debt (excluding payables) will 
increase to 90%-95% over the next 12-18 months 
from 85% in 2020.


Adjusted EBIT/interest for both Evergrande and Hengda will improve because 
of the leverage trend. Specifically, Moody's expects that 
Evergrande's EBIT/interest will improve to 1.5x-2.0x 
over the next 12-18 months from 1.4x in 2020, while 
Hengda's EBIT/interest will rise to 2.0x-2.5x from 
1.7x over the same period.


Hengda's B2 CFR reflects the company's strong market position as one of 
the top property developers in China in terms of contracted sales and 
the size of its land bank. The rating also reflects Hengda's nationwide 
geographic coverage, strong sales execution, low-cost 
land bank and focus on mass-market residential properties. 
However, the CFR is constrained by the company's moderate 
debt leverage, sizable maturing debt over the next 12-18 
months and high proportion of trust loans.


Evergrande's B3 senior unsecured rating is one notch below its CFR, 
reflecting structural subordination. This risk reflects the fact 
that most of the claims are at the operating subsidiaries and have priority 
over claims at the holding company in a bankruptcy scenario. In 
addition, the holding company lacks significant mitigating factors 
for structural subordination. As a result, the expected recovery 
rate for claims at the holding company will be lower.


Tianji's B3 CFR reflects the company's standalone credit profile and a 
one-notch rating uplift, based on Moody's expectation that 
Hengda will provide financial support to Tianji when needed.


The one-notch uplift reflects (1) Hengda's full ownership of Tianji; 
(2) Tianji's status as the primary platform for Hengda to invest in offshore 
property projects and raise offshore funds; and (3) Hengda's track 
record of providing financial support to Tianji.


Tianji's standalone credit profile factors in its moderately large scale, 
weak liquidity and weak credit metrics.


The B3 senior unsecured rating on the notes guaranteed by Tianji considers 
Moody's expectation that support from Hengda mitigates the risk of structural 
subordination.


In terms of environmental, social and governance (ESG) risks, 
Moody's has considered Evergrande's concentrated ownership 
by its key shareholders, Hui Ka Yan and his wife, who held 
a 77% stake in the company as of the end of 2020. Nevertheless, 
Evergrande's established internal governance structures and standards, 
as required under the Corporate Governance Code for companies listed on 
the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, mitigate this risk. Evergrande's 
board has a total of nine members, three of which are independent 
nonexecutive directors.


The company is transparent in disclosing its business and financial activities. 
However, its financial policy favors the use of debt leverage that 
maximizes returns to shareholders.


FACTORS THAT COULD LEAD TO AN UPGRADE OR DOWNGRADE OF THE RATINGS


Moody's review will focus on (1) Evergrande's access to funding and its 
refinancing and its liquidity risks, specifically its ability to 
address its maturing debt (including puttable bonds) in a timely manner, 
(2) the company's ability to reduce its leverage and payables on 
a sustained basis, and (3) its ability to reduce its reliance on 
trust loans in its debt composition.


Moody's could downgrade the rating if Evergrande fails to materially reduce 
its debt and payables to more sustainable levels or maintain its adequate 
liquidity.


An upgrade of the ratings is unlikely given the review for downgrade. 
However, Moody's could return the rating outlook to stable 
if Evergrande improves its access to funding, and materially reduces 
its debt and payables and reliance on trust loans such that its capital 
structure becomes more sustainable in nature.

"
4,4,Moody,Evergrande,,https://www.moodys.com/research/Moodys-downgrades-Evergrandes-and-its-subsidiaries-ratings-changes-outlook-to--PR_451820,"


Hong Kong, August 02, 2021 -- Moody's Investors Service has downgraded the corporate family rating 
(CFR) and senior unsecured ratings of China Evergrande Group (""Evergrande""), 
the CFRs of Hengda Real Estate Group Company Limited and Tianji Holding 
Limited, and the backed senior unsecured ratings of Scenery Journey 
Limited.


The affected ratings are as follows:


-- Evergrande's CFR has been downgraded to Caa1 from B2, 
and its senior unsecured ratings have been downgraded to Caa2 from B3;


-- Hengda's CFR has been downgraded to Caa1 from B2;


-- Tianji's CFR has been downgraded to Caa2 from B3; 
and


-- Scenery Journey's backed senior unsecured ratings have 
been downgraded to Caa2 from B3.


The backed senior unsecured rating on the notes issued by Scenery Journey 
are guaranteed by Tianji. The notes are also supported by a keepwell 
deed and a deed of equity interest purchase undertaking between Hengda, 
Tianji, Scenery Journey and the bond trustee.


At the same time, Moody's has changed the rating outlook to 
negative from ratings under review.


These actions conclude Moody's review for downgrade initiated on 30 June 
2021.


""The downgrades reflect Evergrande's heightened refinancing risk over 
the coming 12-18 months given its weakened funding access and liquidity 
position. We also expect its profit margins to decline as the company 
lowers the selling prices of its properties to preserve liquidity,"" 
says Cedric Lai, a Moody's Vice President and Senior Analyst.


The company's funding access has weakened, as demonstrated by its 
highly volatile onshore and offshore bond prices, following reduced 
investors' and creditors' confidence amid continued negative news regarding 
the company.


The negative outlook reflects Moody's expectation that the company's 
liquidity profile will remain weak over the next 12-18 months.


RATINGS RATIONALE


Evergrande's Caa1 CFR reflects the company's nationwide geographic coverage, 
strong sales execution and low-cost land bank. However, 
the rating takes into consideration the company's sizable maturing debt 
over the next 12-18 months, high proportion of trust loans 
and moderate credit metrics. In addition, the company's significant 
investments in non-property businesses also constrain its credit 
profile.


Evergrande's liquidity position is weak. The company's cash on 
hand of RMB181 billion as of the end of 2020 was not sufficient to cover 
its short-term debt of RMB335 billion as of the same date.


Given its weakened access to funding, the company will need to focus 
on generating internal cash to repay its maturing debts and fund its operations 
in 2021. The company's primary objective of generating cash 
from property sales will continue to squeeze its profit margins. 
As such, Moody's expects Evergrande's gross margin to 
further decline to 16%-18% over the next 12-18 
months from 24% in 2020.


In the first half of 2021, the company's contracted sales grew 3% 
from a year ago to RMB356.8 billion, but its average selling 
price dropped to RMB8,295 per square meter (sqm), compared 
with RMB8,945 per sqm in 2020 and RMB10,281 per sqm in 2019. 



Meanwhile, Moody's expects that Evergrande will reduce spending 
on land and control debt growth over the next 12-18 months, 
given its high debt leverage. Accordingly, Moody's expects 
the company's debt leverage to improve over the next 12-18 
months.


On the other hand, its interest coverage will weaken because of 
the expected decline fall in gross margins. Specifically, 
Moody's expects Evergrande's EBIT/interest to decrease slightly to 1.3x 
over the next 12-18 months from 1.4x in 2020, while 
Hengda's EBIT/interest will reduce slightly to 1.6x from 1.7x 
over the same period.


Hengda's credit profile is closely linked to that of Evergrande. 
In 2020, Hengda accounted for 88% of Evergrande's revenue 
and 81% of its reported debt. Specifically, Hengda's 
Caa1 CFR reflects the company's nationwide geographic coverage, 
strong sales execution, low-cost land bank and focus on mass-market 
residential properties. However, the rating takes into consideration 
the company's sizable maturing debt over the next 12-18 months, 
high proportion of trust loans and moderate credit metrics.


Evergrande's Caa2 senior unsecured rating is one notch below its CFR, 
reflecting structural subordination. This risk reflects the fact 
that most of the claims are at the operating subsidiaries and have priority 
over claims at the holding company in a bankruptcy scenario. In 
addition, the holding company lacks significant mitigating factors 
for structural subordination. As a result, the expected recovery 
rate for claims at the holding company will be lower.


Tianji's Caa2 CFR reflects the company's standalone credit profile and 
a one-notch rating uplift, based on Moody's expectation that 
Hengda will provide financial support to Tianji when needed.


The one-notch uplift reflects (1) Hengda's full ownership of Tianji; 
(2) Tianji's status as the primary platform for Hengda to invest in offshore 
property projects and raise offshore funds; and (3) Hengda's track 
record of providing financial support to Tianji.


Tianji's standalone credit profile factors in its moderately large scale, 
weak liquidity and weak credit metrics.


The Caa2 senior unsecured rating on the notes guaranteed by Tianji considers 
Moody's expectation that support from Hengda mitigates the risk of structural 
subordination.


In terms of environmental, social and governance (ESG) considerations, 
Moody's has considered the company's weak financial management, 
given that its financial policy favors the use of debt leverage that maximizes 
returns to shareholders.


The rating also considered the company's concentrated ownership by its 
key shareholders, Hui Ka Yan and his wife, who held a 77% 
stake in the company as of the end of 2020.


FACTORS THAT COULD LEAD TO AN UPGRADE OR DOWNGRADE OF THE RATINGS


An upgrade is unlikely given the negative outlook.


However, the outlook could return to stable if Evergrande improves 
its access to funding, and reduces its debt and payables such that 
its capital structure becomes more sustainable in nature.


On the other hand, Moody's could downgrade the ratings if 
Evergrande's access to funding and liquidity deteriorate further.

"
5,5,Moody,Evergrande,,https://www.moodys.com/research/Moodys-downgrades-Evergrandes-and-its-subsidiaries-ratings-outlook-negative--PR_453870,"


Hong Kong, September 07, 2021 -- Moody's Investors Service has downgraded the Corporate Family Rating 
(CFR) and senior unsecured ratings of China Evergrande Group (Evergrande), 
the CFRs of Hengda Real Estate Group Company Limited and Tianji Holding 
Limited, and the backed senior unsecured ratings of Scenery Journey 
Limited.


The affected ratings are as follows:


-- Evergrande's CFR has been downgraded to Ca from Caa1, 
and its senior unsecured ratings have been downgraded to C from Caa2;


-- Hengda's CFR has been downgraded to Ca from Caa1;


-- Tianji's CFR has been downgraded to C from Caa2; 
and


-- Scenery Journey's backed senior unsecured ratings have 
been downgraded to C from Caa2.


The backed senior unsecured rating on the notes issued by Scenery Journey 
are guaranteed by Tianji. The notes are also supported by a keepwell 
deed and a deed of equity interest purchase undertaking between Hengda, 
Tianji, Scenery Journey and the bond trustee.


The outlook on the ratings remains negative.


""The downgrades reflect Evergrande's heightened liquidity and default 
risks given its sizable amount of maturing debt over the next 6-12 
months,"" says Cedric Lai, a Moody's Vice President and Senior 
Analyst.


""The downgrades also reflect the weak recovery prospects of Evergrande's 
creditors, if there is a default,"" adds Lai.


The negative outlook reflects Moody's view that the recovery prospects 
of Evergrande's creditors could weaken further if the company defaults 
on its maturing debt.


RATINGS RATIONALE


Evergrande's Ca CFR reflects the company's high liquidity risks 
over the next 6-12 months, limited financial flexibility 
and weak recovery prospects for its creditors.


Evergrande's unrestricted cash on hand of RMB86.8 billion as of 
end June 2021 is not sufficient to cover its short-term debt and 
maturing long-term debt over the next 12 months. In addition, 
the company will unlikely be able to raise sufficient new funds for refinancing 
given its deteriorated funding access to onshore and offshore markets.


Evergrande will have to rely on asset sales or investments from potential 
investors to generate funds for debt servicing, but these fundraising 
activities entail high uncertainties.


Evergrande's C senior unsecured rating is one notch below its CFR, 
reflecting the lower expected recovery rate for its senior unsecured creditors 
due to structural subordination. This risk reflects the fact that 
most of the claims are at the operating subsidiaries and have priority 
over claims at the holding company in a bankruptcy scenario. In 
addition, the holding company lacks significant mitigating factors 
for structural subordination.


As a core subsidiary and majority owned by Evergrande, Hengda's 
credit profile is closely linked with that of Evergrande, in our 
view.


Tianji's C CFR and the C senior unsecured rating on the notes guaranteed 
by Tianji reflect its weak standalone credit profile, high liquidity 
risk over the next 6-12 months and low recovery value.


In terms of environmental, social and governance (ESG) considerations, 
Moody's has considered Evergrande's weak financial management, given 
that its financial policy favors the use of debt leverage that maximizes 
returns to shareholders.


The rating also considered Evergrande's concentrated ownership by its 
key shareholders, Hui Ka Yan and his wife, who held a 77% 
stake in the company as of the end of 2020.


FACTORS THAT COULD LEAD TO AN UPGRADE OR DOWNGRADE OF THE RATINGS


An upgrade is unlikely given the negative outlook.


However, positive rating momentum could develop if Evergrande repays 
its maturing debt and improves its liquidity position materially.
